# Ribbitz Dashboard Rebuild — Progress Log

Dated, factual entries only — this is a log for AI-to-AI handoff, not a
report. See `REBUILD_PLAN.md` §6 for the required format and protocol.

- Did: Phase 1 complete. Owner said "proceed" to the plan.
- Did: installed `react-grid-layout` (confirmed still active/maintained
  first — v2.2.4, 2.8M weekly downloads). Not wired up yet, that's Phase 2.
- Did: wrote `ui/src/characters/schema.js` (JSDoc typedefs +
  `ELEMENT_TYPES` catalog constant — single source of truth for the shape).
- Did: scaffolded the file-based storage convention —
  `ui/src/characters/README.md`, plus a small hand-written example
  (`characters/ribbitz/character.json` + `elements/skills.json`, 2 real
  Skills elements with correct current math) to prove the shape works
  against real content. **Not loaded by the running app yet** — nothing
  imports these files. Do not be surprised the dashboard looks unchanged.
- Corrected an error in the plan doc itself: §3.4 originally assumed
  `App.css` already had CSS custom properties to extract for theming. It
  doesn't — audited, zero found, 79 hardcoded color literals instead.
  Fixed in place in REBUILD_PLAN.md §3.4; theming is a from-scratch build
  in Phase 4, not an extraction.
- Verified: `npm run build` passes, 328 modules (same as before this
  session's changes) — confirms no visible/behavioral change yet, as
  required for Phase 1.
- Committed + pushed.
- Blocked on: nothing — ready to start Phase 2 (DashboardCanvas.jsx +
  migrate Skills as the proof-of-concept category) whenever a session picks
  this up next.
- Next AI should: start Phase 2 per REBUILD_PLAN.md §4. Build
  `DashboardCanvas.jsx` + a `roll-topic` element renderer, load
  `characters/ribbitz/character.json` + `elements/skills.json` (the Phase 1
  example — extend it to the *rest* of Skills, not just Athletics/Stealth,
  as part of this phase), get real drag/resize/persist working, and confirm
  the existing dice-roll wiring (`rollDice` in `App.jsx` — extract into
  `lib/diceRoller.js` per §3.6 while you're in there) still works end to
  end through the new canvas. Ship this alongside the old hardcoded Skills
  UI (don't remove the old one until the new one is owner-confirmed
  working) — see Phase 2/3 notes in the plan for why.

## 2026-09-14 — Claude (session_01HxUfGH7xyRjP9JoeBgPrJH)
- Did: wrote `REBUILD_PLAN.md` (master plan for the dashboard rebuild) and
  this log, per owner's request for a detailed plan + backup before starting.
- Did: backed up current state — committed all outstanding changes in
  `/srv/docker/ribbitz` (dice-tool integration, Cloudkill/Contagion spell
  additions, skill Check/Save buttons, Magic Abilities click-to-expand,
  dashboard flex-wrap layout fix), tagged `pre-rebuild-2026-09-14`, pushed
  both `main` and the tag to `origin` (GitHub). This tag is the safe
  rollback point if the rebuild goes wrong.
- Did: linked this plan from `/Data/AI-Handoffs/FullScopeHandoff.md`.
- Decided (needs owner confirmation before Phase 1 starts): recommended
  `react-grid-layout` for the drag/resize/reflow canvas (plan §3.3);
  recommended file-based per-character JSON for element storage over a new
  DB (plan §3.1).
- Also flagged, not yet acted on: Stream Commander
  (`/srv/docker/stream-commander`) has no git repo at all despite heavy
  active development — recommend initializing one, out of scope for this
  specific plan but worth a separate ask to the owner.
- Blocked on: owner approval to begin Phase 1 (data model + conventions).
- Next AI should: read `REBUILD_PLAN.md` in full first (especially §6),
  confirm with the owner whether Phase 1 is approved to start, and if so,
  resolve the two "needs confirmation" decisions above before writing any
  code.
