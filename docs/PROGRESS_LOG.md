# Ribbitz Dashboard Rebuild — Progress Log

Dated, factual entries only — this is a log for AI-to-AI handoff, not a
report. See `REBUILD_PLAN.md` §6 for the required format and protocol.

- Did: wrote `REBUILD_PLAN.md` (master plan for the dashboard rebuild) and
  this log, per owner's request for a detailed plan + backup before starting.
- Did: backed up current state — committed all outstanding changes in
  `/srv/docker/ribbitz` (dice-tool integration, Cloudkill/Contagion spell
  additions, skill Check/Save buttons, Magic Abilities click-to-expand,
  dashboard flex-wrap layout fix), tagged `pre-rebuild-2026-09-14`, pushed
  both `main` and the tag to `origin` (GitHub). This tag is the safe
  rollback point if the rebuild goes wrong.
- Did: linked this plan from `/Data/AI-Handoffs/FullScopeHandoff.md`.
- Decided (needs owner confirmation before Phase 1 starts): recommended
  `react-grid-layout` for the drag/resize/reflow canvas (plan §3.3);
  recommended file-based per-character JSON for element storage over a new
  DB (plan §3.1).
- Also flagged, not yet acted on: Stream Commander
  (`/srv/docker/stream-commander`) has no git repo at all despite heavy
  active development — recommend initializing one, out of scope for this
  specific plan but worth a separate ask to the owner.
- Blocked on: owner approval to begin Phase 1 (data model + conventions).
- Next AI should: read `REBUILD_PLAN.md` in full first (especially §6),
  confirm with the owner whether Phase 1 is approved to start, and if so,
  resolve the two "needs confirmation" decisions above before writing any
  code.
