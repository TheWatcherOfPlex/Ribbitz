<details>
<summary><h3>🍃 Druidic</h3></summary>

**Official Text (PHB 66):**
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🐺 Wild Shape</h3></summary>

**Ribbitz's Wild Shape:**
- Uses: 2/Short Rest
- Max CR: 1
- Duration: 4.5 hours (= Druid level 9 / 2)

**Official Text (PHB 66):**
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

| Level | Max. CR | Limitations | Example |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2nd | 1/4 | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf |
| 4th | 1/2 | No flying speed | Crocodile |
| 8th | 1 | - | Giant eagle |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🦊 Wild Companion (Optional)</h3></summary>

**Official Text (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything 35):**
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the Find Familiar spell, without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.

</details>

<details>

**Ribbitz's Halo:**
- Damage: 1d6 necrotic (2d6 with Symbiotic Entity)
- Range: 10 feet
- Save DC: 17

**Official Text (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything 36):**
Starting at 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

| Druid Level | Damage |
|-------------|--------|
| 2nd | 1d4 necrotic |

**Ribbitz's Symbiotic Entity:**

- Duration: 10 minutes
- Effects: Halo damage doubled (2d6), melee attacks +1d6 necrotic

**Official Text (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything 37):**
Also at 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

- When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
- Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🧟 Fungal Infestation (Circle of Spores 6th Level)</h3></summary>

**Ribbitz's Fungal Infestation:**
- Uses: 4/Long Rest (= WIS modifier)
- Range: 10 feet
- Zombie HP: 1
- Duration: 1 hour

**Official Text (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything 37):**
At 6th level, your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the Zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
