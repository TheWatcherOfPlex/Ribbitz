<summary><h2>PreCampaign Ribbitz Backstory (click to expand)</h2></summary>

*"Those who have seen, have the sight."*

* **Origins:** Born in the Genesis Pond under **The Great Golden Risabere** on Mt. Zenith. Raised in the **Caverns of Consciousness** to study farm management and plant lore.
* **Mentorship:** Studied under **Darako** (Blue Grung), mastering medicinal herbs, smokes, and tonics.
* **The Restless Purple:** Unlike traditional Purple Grung, Ribbitz longed for the outside. He befriended **Perac** (Orange Grung hunter) and begged to join the hunt.
* **The Double Hop Stomp:** Developed a signature hunting technique with Perac, combining Ribbitz's thirst-poison and Perac's fear-poison to drive boars into river-side traps.
* **The Ascension:** During his ceremony, Ribbitz presented Risabere with Moose antlers and the **Arcana Maximus** (lighting-blue mushroom).
* **Eyes of the Golden:** In an unprecedented move, Risabere named Ribbitz and Perac as the first "Eyes of the Golden"—royal seeker-rangers sent to investigate new powers and find allies.
* **Awakened Magic:** Blessed with glowing azure eye markings and having consumed the Blue Mushroom, Ribbitz's "frog magic" was unlocked.
* **The Journey South:** Dispatched to human settlements to trade for secrets and learn about the world. He was last seen at **Umbra Academy** undergoing trials.

**Key Names & Figures:**
* **The Great Golden Risabere:** Visionary King; established meritocratic "Ascension" and reformatory "Fall."
* **Perac (Orange):** Best friend, hunting mentor, and fellow "Eye of the Golden."
* **Darako (Blue):** Medicinal mentor; still cares for Ribbitz's gardens in the caverns.
* **Adalle Retovic:** Wizard of Talgar whose stranded accounts preserve these legends.
* **Simon Smeck:** Translator of Ribbitz's legend into Common.
* **Dr. Daryll Fenham, Ph.D.:** Recipient and archivist of the translated accounts.

*See official “Ribbits Backstory” document for full details.*
