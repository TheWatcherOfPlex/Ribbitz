- If you’re the DM: feel free to browse and reference during sessions.
- These pages are updated during sessions; you may want to refresh often during gameplay as things will get edited live.

### 🖥️ UI Launcher & Dashboard Layout

- Use `Launch Ribbitz Program.bat` in the repo root to start the full local stack:
  - Express sync server (`http://127.0.0.1:5175`)
  - React/Vite UI (`http://127.0.0.1:5174`)
  - OBS stat watcher script
- The UI dashboard layout is tuned for wide screens: the Combat Kit grid uses two columns, and full-width sections (Grung Abilities + Drugs & Herbs) span across both columns.
- Combat Kit weapon blocks follow the same format: **Hit** (Std/Pwr), **Std**, **Pwr**, **Elem**, **Gloom** lines for quick in-session reading.

### 🐳 Docker + Subpath Hosting

- This repo now includes a production Dockerfile that builds the Vite UI and serves it through the Express server.
- For DiceKnights integration under a subpath, set build args:
  - `VITE_BASE_PATH=/ribbits-app/`
  - `VITE_API_BASE=/ribbits-app/api`
- Runtime API + offline settings remain controlled by server env:
  - `APPS_SCRIPT_WEBAPP_URL`
  - `OFFLINE_SNAPSHOT_PATH`
  - `FILE_STORAGE_DIR`
