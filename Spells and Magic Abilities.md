**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet

## Detect Magic (Ritual)
**Source:** *Player's Handbook* (2014) — p. 231

### Official Text
**Level:** 1st-level divination (ritual)  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
- Ritual option: no slot spent if cast as ritual (adds 10 min to casting time)
- Sense range: **30 feet**

## Jump

## Disguise Self
**Source:** *Player's Handbook* (2014) — p. 233

### Official Text
**Level:** 1st-level illusion  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>Investigation check vs DC 17</b></span> to see through disguise

# 🍄 2nd Level Spells

## Healing Spirit (Concentration)
**Source:** *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* (2017) — p. 157

### Official Text
**Level:** 2nd-level conjuration  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the Spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>Heals 1d6 per use</b></span> at 2nd level
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>Number of heals = 5</b></span> (1 + WIS mod 4)
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>3rd level = 2d6 per use</b></span>
- Dice macro: **Spell Healing Spirit Heal** (currently `1d6`, adjust for table/errata later)

## Moonbeam (Concentration)
**Source:** *Player's Handbook* (2014) — p. 261

### Official Text
**Level:** 2nd-level evocation  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>Save DC = 17</b></span>
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>Damage at 2nd level = 2d10 radiant</b></span> (half on success)
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>Damage at 3rd level = 3d10 radiant</b></span>
- Dice macros:
  - **Spell Moonbeam L2 Fail** / **Spell Moonbeam L2 Succ (Half)**
  - **Spell Moonbeam L3 Fail** / **Spell Moonbeam L3 Succ (Half)**

## Pass Without Trace (Concentration)
**Source:** *Player's Handbook* (2014) — p. 264

### Official Text
**Level:** 2nd-level abjuration  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>+10 bonus to Stealth</b></span>
- Affects creatures within **30 feet** of you
- Duration: **Concentration, up to 1 hour**

## Rope Trick
**Source:** *Player's Handbook* (2014) — p. 272

### Official Text
**Level:** 2nd-level transmutation  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.

The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view outside the space.

Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.

Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
- Duration: **1 hour**
- Capacity: **8 Medium or smaller creatures**

## Blindness/Deafness
**Source:** *Player's Handbook* (2014) — p. 219

### Official Text
**Level:** 2nd-level necromancy  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 1 minute

You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>Save DC = 17</b></span>
- Duration: **1 minute** (target can repeat save each turn)
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>At 3rd level = 2 creatures</b></span>

## Gentle Repose (Ritual)
**Source:** *Player's Handbook* (2014) — p. 245

### Official Text
**Level:** 2nd-level necromancy (ritual)  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse's eyes, which must remain there for the duration)  
**Duration:** 10 days

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can't become undead.

The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
- Ritual option: no slot spent if cast as ritual (adds 10 min to casting time)
- Duration: **10 days**

## Halo of Spores (Reaction)
**Source:** *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* (2020) — p. 36

### Official Text
**Circle of Spores Feature (2nd level)**

You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>Save DC = 17</b></span>
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>Damage at Druid Level 9 = 1d6</b></span> necrotic (6th level threshold reached)

## Symbiotic Entity
**Source:** *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* (2020) — p. 37

### Official Text
**Circle of Spores Feature (2nd level)**

You gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

- When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
- Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
- <span style="color: #8a2be2;"><b>Temp HP = 36</b></span> (4 × Druid level 9)
- Duration: **10 minutes** (or until temp HP depleted or Wild Shape used again)
- While active: Halo damage die is rolled **twice**; melee attacks gain **+1d6 necrotic**

## Fungal Infestation
**Source:** *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* (2020) — p. 37

### Official Text
**Circle of Spores Feature (6th level)**

Your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the Zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

### Ribbitz Notes / Math
