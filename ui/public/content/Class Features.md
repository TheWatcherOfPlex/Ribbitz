**Ribbitz's Choices:** Snakes/Yuan-ti, Orcs

**Official Text (PHB 91):**
Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level.

Also at 1st level, you are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:
- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
- Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
- When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
- While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

## 🍄 Druid 9 (Circle of Spores)

> **Full Reference:** [Quick Reference - Druid Class](./Reference%20Materials/Quick%20Reference%20-%20Druid%20Class.md)  
> **Circle Reference:** [Quick Reference - Circle of Spores](./Reference%20Materials/Quick%20Reference%20-%20Druid%20Class%20-%20Circle%20of%20Spores.md)

<details>
<summary><h3>🍃 Druidic</h3></summary>

**Official Text (PHB 66):**
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🐺 Wild Shape</h3></summary>

**Ribbitz's Wild Shape:**
- Uses: 2/Short Rest
- Max CR: 1
- Duration: 4.5 hours (= Druid level 9 / 2)

**Official Text (PHB 66):**
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

| Level | Max. CR | Limitations | Example |
|-------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2nd | 1/4 | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf |
| 4th | 1/2 | No flying speed | Crocodile |
| 8th | 1 | - | Giant eagle |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🦊 Wild Companion (Optional)</h3></summary>

**Official Text (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything 35):**
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the Find Familiar spell, without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>☠️ Halo of Spores (Circle of Spores 2nd Level)</h3></summary>

**Ribbitz's Halo:**
- Damage: 1d6 necrotic (2d6 with Symbiotic Entity)
- Range: 10 feet
- Save DC: 17

**Official Text (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything 36):**
Starting at 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

| Druid Level | Damage |
|-------------|--------|
| 2nd | 1d4 necrotic |
| 6th | 1d6 necrotic |
| 10th | 1d8 necrotic |
| 14th | 1d10 necrotic |

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🦠 Symbiotic Entity (Circle of Spores 2nd Level)</h3></summary>

**Ribbitz's Symbiotic Entity:**
- Temp HP: 36 (= 4 × Druid level 9)
- Duration: 10 minutes
- Effects: Halo damage doubled (2d6), melee attacks +1d6 necrotic

**Official Text (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything 37):**
Also at 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain 4 temporary hit points for each level you have in this class. While this feature is active, you gain the following benefits:

- When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.
- Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to any target they hit.

These benefits last for 10 minutes, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🧟 Fungal Infestation (Circle of Spores 6th Level)</h3></summary>

**Ribbitz's Fungal Infestation:**
- Uses: 4/Long Rest (= WIS modifier)
- Range: 10 feet
- Zombie HP: 1
- Duration: 1 hour

**Official Text (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything 37):**
At 6th level, your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and animate it. If a beast or a humanoid that is Small or Medium dies within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to animate it, causing it to stand up immediately with 1 hit point. The creature uses the Zombie stat block in the Monster Manual. It remains animate for 1 hour, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn comes immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the only action it can take is the Attack action, making one melee attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>📖 Ritual Casting</h3></summary>

**Official Text (PHB 66):**
You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

## 🧩 Feats

<details>
<summary><h3>🎯 Sharpshooter</h3></summary>

> **Full Reference:** [Quick Reference - Sharpshooter Feat](./Reference%20Materials/Quick%20Reference%20-%20Sharpshooter%20Feat.md)

**Ribbitz's Benefits:**
- No disadvantage at long range
- Ignore half and three-quarters cover
- Power Shot: -5 to hit for +10 damage

**Official Text (PHB 170):**
You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:

- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
- Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
- Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If that attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>🧚 Fey Touched</h3></summary>

**Ribbitz's Benefits:**
- +1 WIS (already applied to total)
- Learn *Misty Step* and *Hunter's Mark*
- Each spell castable 1×/Long Rest for free

**Official Text (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything 79):**
Your exposure to the Feywild's magic has changed you, granting you the following benefits:

- Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You learn the Misty Step spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the divination or enchantment school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
